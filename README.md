# TCDB 2 iOS

## About

After 12 years, the ACM award wining Tech Consultant Database: TCDB (originally UCDB) is due for an update.  TCDB handles shift scheduling, time clocking, and employee management, and provides an employee directory and static information and announcement pages for the Grinnell College ITS Tech Consultant team.  This project aims to duplicate the functionality of TCDB for iOS while at the same time improving upon and expanding the original features and interface where prudent.
